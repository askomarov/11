      The pm2.5 charcoal filters used in PROORB make sure that not only are solid and semi-solid particles filtered off,
      but
      also smoke, ash, bad-odour and soot are thoroughly removed from the air that the wearer is inhaling.
    </p>
    <p class="overview-slide__text">
      This makes the air <b>99.97%</b> clean for the wearer to breathe. Contemporarily, all the visors in the market
      have fixed
      filters, however, PROORB has modular filters containing discs. The company offers PROORB with <b>HEPA</b> and
      <b>charcoal</b>
      filters,
      but due to their modular nature, the wearer can put any filter of their choice in these discs depending on
      individual
      preferences.
